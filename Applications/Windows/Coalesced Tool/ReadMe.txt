UPDATE :
Piquick was nice enough to upload the full game XEX. I thank him for that. I am using a static offset for the XEX in locating the “HashSec” inside which may pose problems. I am fully aware of this and hopefully will find a way of properly calculating it. If not it doesn’t seem that bad.

UPDATE :
Nate redid the UI for me and I recoded some of the XEX patcher.

Directions on how to use…


1.	Extract the files 'Coalesced.ini', 'Coalesced.int', 'Coalesced.deu', 'Coalesced.fra', 'Coalesced.esn', 'Coalesced.ita', 'Xbox360TOC.txt', and 'default.xex' then copy them all in the same folder. If it’s the full game include ‘Coalesced.rus’ as well. Don’t be afraid if these files don’t exist, it will skip the file in the XEX while patching if the file isn’t present.

2.	Use X360GameHacker to patch the XEX and remove its security and whatnot using ALL of its default settings.  << VURRY VURRY IMPORTANT

3.	Use the unpacker and packer to modify the files.

4.	Make sure your modified files are all in the same folder as the XEX.

5.	Click Patch XEX for demo or retail. Whichever one you are modding.

6.	Everything should be done at that point. Make sure you inject everything back. If one hash in the XEX is wrong the game will freeze.

NOTE: The Coalesced files are located in the folders “…\TdGame\Config\Xenon\Cooked\” and “…\TdGame\Localization\” and “'Xbox360TOC.txt” is located in “…\TdGame\”.

I need testers badly so I know if it works (I know, I sound like a broken record x3). If you have any questions, concerns, suggestions, or bugs to report do not hesitate. I am happy to respond.

My thanks go to Unknown V2, Nate, Dakote, and Piquick.

Happy Modding ^.^
