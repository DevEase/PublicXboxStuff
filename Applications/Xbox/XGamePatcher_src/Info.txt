XGamePatcher - mojobojo 2011

What is this?
Patches game executables when they start up.

Patches go into a folder named "Patches" in the root directory of a USB stick or HDD.
The patch names are the games Title ID with a ".patch" at the end (Quake would be Usb:\Patches\584108C8.patch). 
Freeboot style patches are used, consult kxampatch_builder for more information.
